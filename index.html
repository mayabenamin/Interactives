     Waystar's existing services have helped patients simplify health-care payments, but 
     Waystar's new generative AI tool could help lighten a heavy and costly load for hospitals: 
     contesting insurance denials.

     Waystar's new technology, named AltitudeCare, creates appeal letters using generative 
     AI. Fighting denied insurance claims costs hospitals and health systems almost 
     $20 billion annually, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/13/health-waystar-generative-ai-new-tool-will-help-fight-health-insurance-denials.html"> CNBC</a>.
     Therefore, Waystar claims Altitude Care could free providers of this tedious work and 
     significantly reduce costs.
