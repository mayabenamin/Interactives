        For the 67th Grammys, music icon Taylor Swift sparkled in a red mini dress. Matching Swift's classic red lip,
        this dress feels fitting, serving as a muted version of her bedazzled outfits during the Eras Tour. However, 
        this attire starkly contrasts Swift's outfit last year.

        <h2> 2024 vs. 2025 </h2>

        At the 2024 Grammys, Swift suprised fans with the announcement of her new album "The Tortured Poets Department." 
        Swift's easter eggs and small hints for her next moves have spurred conspiracy and confusion among fans. Patiently
        awaiting the release of "Reputation (Taylor's Version)," fans continue to mistake easter eggs and inaccuratley
        predict when Swift will announce the album. However, could this year's Grammys outfit serve as a strong clue?
    <p>
        When Swift announced TTPD, she wore a dress that perfectly matched the vibe of the album. In fact, Swift donned
        a similar dress when she performed songs from the new album during her Eras Tour.
